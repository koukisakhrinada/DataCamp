    "\n",
    "1. What is the OpenAI API?: Welcome to this course! I'm James, and I'll be your host as we explore the artificial intelligence functionality available via the OpenAI API!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Coming up...: In this course, you'll learn how to use the AI models available through the OpenAI API to solve a wide range of real-world tasks. To do this, we'll be using Python code throughout the course, and expect familiarity with a few Python programming topics like subsetting lists and dictionaries, control flow, and looping. However, no experience with AI or machine learning is required. With that, let's dive right in!\n",
    "- **Course goals**\n",
    "  - Use the OpenAI API to access AI models\n",
    "  - Use those models to solve various tasks\n",
    "  - Use Python code to do this!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expected knowledge**\n",
    "  - Subsetting Python lists and dictionaries\n",
    "  - Control flow: `if`, `elif`, `else`\n",
    "  - Loops: `for`, `while`\n",

    "  - AI or machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "3. OpenAI, ChatGPT, and the OpenAI API: OpenAI is a company that researches and develops artificial intelligence systems. One of their most famous developments is ChatGPT, which is an application that allows users to communicate with an AI-powered chatbot to ask questions, perform tasks, or generate content. The OpenAI API allows individuals or organizations to access and customize any of the models developed and released by OpenAI. If OpenAI was a car manufacturer, ChatGPT would be their shiny new sports car that people can walk into a dealership and test drive. The OpenAI API would be like the system customers could use to customize and order any car from the manufacturer's catalog.\n",
    "- **OpenAI**: AI R&D company\n",
    "- **ChatGPT**: AI application\n",
    "- **OpenAI API**: Interface for accessing OpenAI models\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is an API?: So what actually is an API? API stands for Application Programming Interface, and they act as a messenger between software applications, taking a request to a system and receiving a response containing data or services. An API is like a waiter in a restaurant; they take our order, or request, communicate it to the kitchen—the system providing the service—and finally, deliver the food, or response from the system, back to our table. Many applications interact using APIs; for example, a mobile weather app may send our location to an API and request the local forecast, which gets returned to our phones.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The OpenAI API: We can similarly write code to interact with the OpenAI API and request the use of one of their models. Our request, in this case, will specify which model we want, the data that we want the model to use, and any other parameters to customize the model's behavior. The response, containing the model result, is then returned to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. API vs. web interface: Some of OpenAI's models, such as ChatGPT, can be used from the web browser, so what are the benefits of accessing them via the API? If we're looking to streamline our individual workflows using AI, then a low-setup web browser experience is likely sufficient for our purposes. However, if we're looking to begin integrating AI into our products, customer experiences, or business processes, we'll need the flexibility of working with the API using a programming language.\n",
    "- **API**\n",
    "  - Provides *flexibility* for integrating AI into products, experiences, and processes\n",
    "  - Interact via programming language\n",
    "- **Web Interface**\n",
    "  - Very little setup\n",
    "  - Sufficient for *streamlining* individual's workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Why the OpenAI API?: The beauty of making these models available via an API is that software engineers, developers, or anyone else wanting to integrate AI into products and services, can now access and implement these models without needing a background in data science or machine learning.\n",
    "- Accessibility to AI\n",
    "- Don't require data or ML experience\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Building AI applications: The OpenAI API has enabled the development of powerful new features, that before, would have required enormous computational resources and data. In the example shown from DataCamp workspace, we developed a feature where users can write or fix code by providing an instruction—all built on the OpenAI API. AI-powered products and services can provide much greater personalization to customers, so experiences can be tailored to an individual's needs and preferences."

    "\n",
    "1. Making requests to the OpenAI API: Welcome back! In this video, you'll learn to make your very first request to the OpenAI API!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. APIs recap...: Recall that we can request the use of a model from OpenAI by making a request to their API.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. API endpoints: Depending on the model or services required, APIs have different access points for users. These access points are called endpoints. Endpoints are a lot like doors in a hospital. Depending on the treatment required, patients use different doors to reach different departments, and likewise, users can use different API endpoints to request different services.\n",
    "- **Endpoints** → API access point designed for specific interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. API authentication: Endpoints, like many hospital departments, may also require authentication before accessing services. API authentication is usually in the form of providing a unique key containing a random assortment of characters.\n",
    "- **Authentication** → Controls on access to API endpoint services (often unique key)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. API usage costs: It's important to note that many APIs, including the OpenAI API, have costs associated with using their services. For OpenAI, these costs are dependent on the model requested and on the size of the model input and output.\n",
    "- [OpenAI pricing](https://openai.com/pricing)\n",
    "- For OpenAI API:\n",
    "  - Larger inputs + outputs = Greater cost\n",
    "\n",
    "6. API documentation: A crucial part of working with APIs is navigating API documentation, which provides details on which endpoints to use, their functionality, and how to set up authentication. Throughout the course, we'll provide these API details, but we also recommend checking out OpenAI's excellent API documentation.\n",
    "- [OpenAI API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Creating an OpenAI API key: Usage of OpenAI's API requires authentication, so to use the API and complete the exercises in this course, you'll need to set up an account. OpenAI often provides free trial credit to new users, which will be more than sufficient for completing this course; however, for some countries, you may need to add a small amount of credit. Creating an OpenAI API key: Then, for authentication, you'll need to create a secret key and copy it. DataCamp doesn't store any API keys used in this course, so you can copy it directly into the exercises. Let's make our first API request!\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Making a request: There are several ways to interact with an API, but in this course, we'll use OpenAI's own Python library, which abstracts away a lot of the complexity of working with an API. We start by importing the OpenAI class from openai, which we'll use to instantiate a Python API client. The client configures the environment for communicating with the API. Within this function, we specify our API key, which is used to authenticate requests. Now for the API request code. We'll start by creating a request to the completions endpoint, which is used for completing a text prompt, by calling the create method on client.completions. Inside this method, we specify the model and the prompt to send to it. We'll discuss prompts in greater detail later in the course. Let's take a look at the API response.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from openai import OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "client = OpenAI(api_key=\"ENTER YOUR KEY HERE\")\n",
    "\n",
    "response = client.completions.create(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\", prompt=\"What is the OpenAI API?\")\n",
    "print(response)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. The response: Here's the response. There's a lot of information in the output, so we'll add some spacing to make it more readable. The response from the API is a Completion object, which has various attributes for accessing the different information it contains. It has an id attribute, and choices, created, model, and other attributes below. We can see that the text response is located under the .choices attribute,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Completion(id='cmpl-8S0D6VZBpM8Vy0fZf6atE71b1Zdvm',\n",
    "           choices=[CompletionChoice(finish_reason='length', index=0, logprobs=None, text='\\n\\nThe OpenAI API is an application programming interface provided by OpenAI, a')],\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Interpreting the response: so we'll start by accessing that. Attributes are accessed using a dot, then the name of the attribute. We've gotten much closer to the text. Notice from the square brackets at the beginning and end, that this is actually a list with a single element. Let's extract the first element to dig further. Ok - now we're left with a CompletionChoice object, which has its own set of attributes. Our text response is located underneath its .text attribute, which we can chain to our existing code. There we have it—our text response as a string! We started off with a complex object, but by taking it one attribute at a time, we were able to get to the result.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(response.choices)\n",

Setting up an organization for the API allows for better management of access, billing, and usage limits to the API. Users can be part of multiple organizations and attribute requests to specific organizations for billing. To attribute a request to a specific organization, we only need to add one more line of code.

They are put in place to ensure fair access to the API, prevent misuse, and also manage the infrastructure that supports the API. For many cases, this may not be an issue, but if a feature is exposed to a large user base, or the requests require generating large bodies of content, they could be at risk of hitting the rate limits.\n",

In this example, we've created separate OpenAI organizations for three different AI-powered features: a customer service chatbot, a content recommendation system, and a video transcript generator. This distributes the requests to reduce the risk of hitting the rate limit. It also removes the single failure point, so an issue to one organization, such as a billing issue, will only result in the failure of a single feature.

    "\n",
    "1. Text completions: In this chapter, we'll take a deeper dive into the rich text and chat functionality the API has to offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Recap...: So far, we've used the Completions endpoint to answer questions, but the model's capabilities go far beyond this. To understand where these capabilities come from, let's take a step back and discuss how text completion works.\n",
    "- Text completions for Q&A\n",
    "```python\n",
    "response = client.completions.create(\n",
    "    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\",\n",
    "    prompt=\"How many days are in October?\"\n",

    "print(response.choices[0].text)\n",
    "[out]:\n",
    "October has 31 days.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is a text completion?: When we send a prompt to the Completions endpoint, the model returns the text that it believes is most likely to complete the prompt, which it infers based on the data the model was developed on. If we send \"Life is like a box of chocolates\" to the model, it correctly completes the quote with high probability. We say high probability here because the model results are non-deterministic, so the model may only correctly complete the quote 98 times out of 100.\n",
    "- Text most likely to complete the prompt\n",
    "```python\n",
    "response = client.completions.create(\n",
    "    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\",\n",
    "    prompt=\"Life is like a box of chocolates.\"\n",

    "You never know what you're going to get.\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Response is non-deterministic (inherently random)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Controlling response randomness: There are many use cases where randomness is undesirable; think of a customer service chatbot - we wouldn't want the chatbot to provide different guidance to customers with the same issue. However, we would like the model to be flexible to different inputs, so there's often a trade off in the amount of randomness. We can control the amount of randomness in the response using the temperature parameter. temperature is set to one by default, but can range from zero to two, where zero is almost entirely deterministic and two is extremely random. If we add a temperature of two here, we can see the model completes the prompt by putting its own bizarre spin on Forrest Gump's famous quote.\n",
    "- `temperature` : control on determinism\n",
    "- Ranges from 0 (highly deterministic) to 2 (very random)\n",
    "```python\n",

    "You never know what bitter constraints to any fate journey of Enlightenment you instead be forced...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Content transformation: Because the text completion model returns the most likely text to follow the prompt, it can be used to solve a number of tasks besides answering questions, including text content generation and transformation. Text transformation involves changing text based on an instruction, and examples include find and replace, summarization, and copyediting. For example, we can use the API to update the name, pronouns, and job title in a bio. Notice that the prompt starts with the instruction, then the text to transform. We've also used triple quotes to define a multi-line prompt for ease of readability and processing. Then, as before, we send this prompt to the Completions endpoint of the API. Voilà! We have our updated text. Even with a find and replace tool, this task would normally require us to specify every word to update.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Content generation: Text completions are also used to generate new text content from a prompt providing an instruction. For example, we can create a request to generate a tagline for a new hot dog stand - the API does a good job, and even includes a subtle pun!\n",
    "```python\n",
    "response = client.completions.create(\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Controlling response length: By default, the response from the API is quite short, which may be unsuitable for many use cases. The max_tokens parameter can be used to control the maximum length of the response.\n",
    "- Default `max_tokens`\n",
    "```python\n",

    "Logic dictates its choices\n",
    "Mankind ponders anew\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Understanding tokens: Tokens are a unit of one or more characters used by language models to understand and interpret text. In English, one token translates to about four characters, and 100 tokens to 75 words, so if our use case requires no more than around 150 words, a max_tokens of 200 would be a good choice.\n",

    "\n",
    "9. Returning to cost: Increasing max_tokens will likely also increase the usage cost for each request. Recall that the usage costs are dependent on the model used and the amount of generated text. Each model is actually priced based upon the cost per 1000 tokens, where input tokens, the tokens used in the prompt, and output tokens, the generated text, can be priced differently. When scoping the potential cost of a new AI feature, the first step is often a back-of-the-envelope calculation to determine the cost per unit time.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Classification tasks: Classification tasks involve assigning a label to a piece of information. This can be identification, such as identifying the language used in a piece of text, categorization, such as sorting geographical locations into countries and US states, or even classifying a statement's sentiment, that is, whether it sounds positive or negative. The Completions endpoint can be used for all of these tasks, providing the model has sufficient knowledge of the subject area and that the prompt contains the necessary context.\n",

Let's say we received a number of online reviews to our restaurant, and we want to extract the sentiment, as numbers one to five, for further analysis. We can write a prompt with the instruction to classify sentiment, and a list of statements, pass it to the Completions endpoint, and print the response. The model does a good job; however, because we didn't specify how to classify the categories, the model didn't realize we actually wanted a numerical output. We can update our prompt so the model has the context on what the categories should be. The updated response contains a reasonable numerical representation of the sentiment of each statement.\n",

    "- The service was very slow: **Negative**\n",
    "- The steak was awfully tasty!: **Positive**\n",
    "- Meal was decent, but I've had better.: **Neutral**\n",
    "- My food was delayed, but drinks were good.: **Mixed**\n",

    "4. My food was delayed, but drinks were good.: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Zero-shot vs. one-shot vs. few-shot prompting: The prompts we've used so far are examples of a so-called zero-shot prompts, where we haven't provided any examples in the prompt for the model to learn from. For many use cases, this may be fine, but for more complex cases where the model may not have a good understanding of the subject matter or task, we may need to provide examples for it to learn from. If one example is provided in the prompt, it's called one-shot prompting, and for more than one, it's called few-shot prompting. Providing examples in the prompt for the model to learn from is called in-context learning, as the model is learning from the context we're providing. Let's return to sentiment analysis to give these prompting techniques a go.\n",
    "- Zero-shot prompting: no examples provided\n",
    "- In-context learning:\n",
    "  - One-shot prompting: one example provided\n",
    "  - Few-shot prompting: a handful of examples provided\n",
    "\n",
    "7. One-shot prompting: We're again dealing with restaurant reviews, but this time, we want the sentiment to be more specific. To do this, we provide one example in the prompt, clearly separating the input and output. Sending this to the Completions endpoint and printing the result shows that the model accurately analyzed the statement, but that it didn't provide any more detail than when we used a zero-shot prompt. In more complex cases, one example is not enough, and we'll need to experiment to determine the number of shots the model needs for the use case.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prompt = \"\"\"Classify sentiment in the following statements:\n",
    "The service was very slow // Disgruntled\n",
    "Meal was decent, but I've had better. //\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",

    "print(response.choices[0].text)\n",
    "\n",
    "[out]:\n",
    "Neutral\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Few-shot prompting: Let's extend the prompt to provide three examples. Running the same code again, we see that the model was much more specific.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prompt = \"\"\"Classify sentiment in the following statements:\n",
    "The service was very slow // Disgruntled\n",
    "The steak was awfully tasty! // Delighted\n",
    "Good experience overall. // Satisfied\n",

    "\n",
    "2. The Chat Completions endpoint: The Chat Completions endpoint allows us to have multi-turn conversations with a model, so we can build on our previous prompts depending on how the model responds. Additionally, chat models often perform just as well as Completions models on single-turn tasks. Compared to the Completions endpoint, Chat Completion allows for better customizability of the response through the use of roles, which we'll discuss in a moment. Finally, there's also a cost benefit to using chat completions models over completions. The cost benefit and flexibility of being able to have multi-turn conversations, means that developers quite often choose a chat model when building applications on the OpenAI API.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Roles: Roles are at the heart of how chat models function. There are three main roles: the system, the user, and the assistant. The system role allows the user to specify a message to control the behavior of the assistant. For example, for a customer service chatbot, we could provide a system message stating that the assistant is a polite and helpful customer service assistant. The user provides an instruction to the assistant, and the assistant responds. One of the interesting things about chat models, is that the user can also provide assistant messages. These are often utilized to provide examples to help the model better understand the user's desired response. We'll discuss multi-turn conversations in the next video; for now, we'll get familiar with using chat models for single-turn tasks.\n",
    "- **System**: controls assistant's behavior\n",

Instead of calling the create method on client.completions, we call it on client.chat.completions; there's also different models for these two endpoints. The main difference is in the way that prompts are provided. For the Completions endpoint, the prompt is passed as a string for the model to complete. Due to the greater customizability of chat models through the use of roles, the prompt is provided in a different way. \n",

    "\n",
    "2. Chat completions for single-turn tasks: Recall that messages are sent to the Chat Completions endpoint as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary provides content to a specific role from either system, user, or assistant. For single turn tasks, no content is sent to the assistant role - the model relies only on its existing knowledge, the behaviors sent to the system role, and the instruction from the user.\n",

    "- **User**: instruct the assistant\n",
    "- **Assistant**: response to user instruction\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Providing examples: Providing assistant messages can be a simple way for developers to steer the model in the right direction without having to surface anything to end-users. If we created a data science tutor application, we could provide a few examples of data science questions and answers that would be sent to the API along with the user's question. Let's improve our data science tutor by providing an example. Between the system message outlining the assistant's behavior and the user's question to answer, we'll add a user and assistant message to serve as an ideal example for the model. We add a user message containing a question on a similar topic and a response that we consider ideally written for our use case. The model now not only has its pre-existing understanding, but also a working example to guide its response.\n",

Building a conversation: To code a conversation, we'll need to create a system so that when a user message is sent, and an assistant response is generated, they are fed back into the messages and stored to be sent with the next user message. Then, when a new user message is provided, the model has the context from the conversation history to draw from. This means that if we introduce ourselves in the first user message, then ask the model what our name is in the second, it should return the correct answer, as it has access to the conversation history. Let's start to code this in Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "7. Coding a conversation: We start by defining some base messages, which can include the system message and any other developer-written examples. Then we can define a list of questions. Here we ask why Python is popular and then ask it to summarize the response provided in one sentence, which requires context on the previous response. Because we want a response for each question, we start by looping over the user_qs list. Next, to prepare the user message string for the API, we need to create a dictionary and add it to the list of messages using the list append method. We can now send the messages to the Chat Completions endpoint and store the response. We extract the assistant's message by subsetting from the API response, converting to a dictionary so it's in the correct format, then adding it to the messages list for the next iteration. Finally, we'll add two print statements so the output is a conversation between the user and assistant written as a script.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "messages = [{\"role\": \"system\",\n",
    "             \"content\": \"You are a data science tutor who provides short, simple explanations.\"}]\n",
    "user_qs = [\"Why is Python so popular?\", \"Summarize this in one sentence.\"]\n",

    "    messages.append(assistant_dict)\n",
    "    print(\"Assistant: \", response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"], \"\\n\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Conversation with an AI: We can see that we were successfully able to provide a follow-up correction to the model's response without having to repeat our question or the model's response.\n",
    "```lang-none\n",
    "User: Why is Python so popular?\n",
    "Assistant: Python is popular for many reasons, including its simplicity, versatility, and wide range of available libraries. It has a relatively easy-to-learn syntax that makes it accessible to beginners and experts alike.

    "3. Text moderation: Text moderation is the process of identifying text that is inappropriate for the context it is being used in. In online communities like social networks and chat rooms, moderation is crucial to prevent the exchange of harmful and offensive content. Traditionally, this moderation was done by-hand, where a team of moderators flagged the content that breached usage rules. More recently this was done by algorithms that detected and flagged content containing particular words. Manual moderation is extremely time-consuming and, if multiple moderators are involved, introduces a subjective element that may result in inconsistencies. Keyword pattern matching, although much quicker and able to run round-the-clock, can be a clumsy tool that misses some malicious content while accidentally flagging perfectly good content because it doesn't understand nuance or the context of the discussion. To prevent the misuse of their own models, OpenAI have developed moderation models to flag content that breaches their usage policies.\n",

    "  - Hate Speech\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Creating a moderations request: To create a request to the Moderations endpoint, we call the create method on client.moderations, and specify that we want the latest moderation model, which often performs the best. If a use case requires greater stability in classifications over time, we can also specify particular model versions. Next is the input, which is the content that the model will consider. This statement could easily be classed as violent by traditional moderation systems that worked by flagging particular keywords. Let's see what OpenAI's moderation model makes of it.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from openai import OpenAI\n",

They can be extracted from the results attribute, and through that, the category_scores attribute.

Notice from the small numbers, including in the violence category, that OpenAI's moderation model did not interpret the statement as containing violent content. The model used the rest of the sentence to interpret the context and accurately infer the statement's meaning.\n",

    "- Larger numbers → greater certainty of violation\n",
    "- Numbers ≠ probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Considerations for implementing moderation: The beauty of having access to these category scores means that we don't have to depend on the final true/false results outputted by the model, we can instead test the model on data from our own particular use case, and set our own thresholds based on the results. For some use cases, such as student communications in a school, strict thresholds may be chosen that flag more content, even if it means accidentally flagging some non-violations. The goal here would be to minimize the number of missed violations, so-called false negatives. Other use cases, such as communications in law enforcement, may use more lenient thresholds so reports on crimes aren't accidentally flagged. Incorrectly flagging a crime report here would be an example of a false positive.\n",
    "- Determine appropriate thresholds for each use case\n",
    "- Stricter thresholds may result in fewer false negatives\n",
    "- More lenient thresholds may result in fewer false positives"

    "\n",
    "1. Speech-to-Text Transcription with Whisper: Welcome back! We're now going to move away from OpenAI's text models to take a look at the functionality of their audio models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. OpenAI's Whisper: OpenAI's Whisper model has speech-to-text capabilities that can be used to create audio transcripts or translate audio from one language into an English transcript. The model supports many of the most common audio file formats, but does place a limit on the size of the audio file. Whisper has potential applications in automating business meeting transcripts and in accessibility features like caption generation. In this video, we'll discuss creating transcription.\n",
    "- Speech-to-text capabilities:\n",
    " - Transcribe audio\n",
    " - Translate and transcribe audio into English\n",
    " - Supports `mp3`, `mp4`, `mpeg`, `mpga`, `m4a`, `wav`, and `webm` (25 MB limit)\n",
    " - Meeting transcripts\n",
    " - Video captions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Loading audio files: Let's use Whisper to transcribe a meeting recording stored in an MP3 audio file. The first thing we need to do is to load the file into our Python environment. There are lots of Python libraries out there for working with audio files, but we'll be using the Python open function here. The open function takes two arguments: the first is the file to be opened, and the second indicates the mode with which the file should be opened. Different modes support reading and writing to virtually any file type. The \"rb\" here stands for read binary - all this means is that we're opening a file that is stored in a binary format, which is typical for non-text files like audio, video, and images. If the audio file is found in a different directory to the Python script or notebook we're working in, we also need to prepend the file name with its path. This audio file can now be used like any other Python variable.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: transcribe meeting_recording_20230602.mp3\n",
    "audio_file = open(\"meeting_recording_20230602.mp3\", \"rb\")\n",
    "\n",

    "audio_file = open(\"path/to/file/meeting_recording_20230602.mp3\", \"rb\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Making a request: Requests to the Whisper model are sent to the Audio endpoint of the API. To create a transcribe request to this endpoint, we call the create method on client.audio.transcriptions. Inside, we specify the audio model to use and the audio file to transcribe. Let's print the response to see what's returned. Like the other endpoints, we receive an object with attributes; but fortunately for transcriptions, there's on a single attribute to handle.\n",
    "- Audio Endpoint\n",

    "[out]:\n",
    "Transcription(text=\"Welcome everyone to the June product monthly. We'll get started in...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The transcript: We can access the transcript text using the text attribute. There we have it! The model did a solid job of transcribing the audio, but note that its performance may fluctuate with changes in audio quality or different accents. Sensitive or confidential audio should also not be sent to the model.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Whisper's translation capabilities: The Whisper model not only has the ability to transcribe audio into the language it's in, but also translate and transcribe audio in one go. This is currently limited to an English transcript, so we can translate and transcribe German into English, but not German into French. Like with its transcription functionality, Whisper can translate audio from most common audio file types up to a particular size limit.\n",

    "- Currently limited to English transcripts\n",
    "- Supports `mp3`, `mp4`, `mpeg`, `mpga`, `m4a`, `wav`, and `webm` (25 MB limit)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Translating audio: The process for translating and transcribing audio is almost identical to normal transcription, with just one change. We open the non-English audio to translate and transcribe, which in this case is an m4a file. This is where the change comes in - instead of using the create method on client.audio.transcriptions, we call it on client.audio.translations. The translated transcription can be extracted using the text attribute. Looking at the transcript, we can see that it wasn't perfect - making two spelling errors. The performance of Whisper can vary wildly depending on audio quality, the language the audio is recorded in, and the model's knowledge of the subject matter. Before creating a full-fledged application on this model, you'll need to test that the model's performance is sufficiently good for the particular use case. Let's see how we can give Whisper a helping hand here.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "audio_file = open(\"non_english_audio.m4a\", \"rb\")\n",

    "4. Bringing prompts into the mix: When we send our audio to the Whisper model, we can also provide an optional prompt. This prompt can be used to improve the quality of the response by providing an example of how we want the transcript to be styled. For example, if we want the transcript to retain filler words from the audio, like ummms and uhhhhs, we can provide the following prompt along with the audio. If we know broadly what the topic of the audio is about, we can also this context as a prompt to help the model narrow-down the correct words. Here's an example of a prompt to give the model more context. Transcriptions also supports prompts that can be used in a very similar way. Let's adapt our last request with a prompt to try and fix the spelling errors outputted by the model.\n",
    "- Can provide prompt to the model (optional)\n",

    "\n",
    "# Example: Provide context\n",
    "prompt=\"A discussion on how to increase revenue.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Adding in a prompt: Let's assume that we know the audio discusses AI trends and ChatGPT; we can define a prompt with this context, and pass it to the prompt argument. Printing the response, shows, that with a little extra context, the model was able to accurately determine the correct spelling and style of the words. In this example, the original response was already pretty close to what we wanted, but for other cases, it's possible to see quite dramatic improvements using prompts.\n",

    "## Combining Models\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Combining models: Welcome back! In this video, we'll take it up a gear and look at how we can combine models together. So far, when we've been using functionality from the OpenAI API, we've completed a task by passing an input to the model and receiving an output. This got us pretty far, from simple question answering to multi-turn conversations and audio translation. But what if we could do more with the model's output. Enter model chaining. Chaining is when models are combined by feeding the output from one model directly into another model as an input. We can chain multiple calls to the same model together or use different models. If we chain two text models together, we can ask the model to perform a task in one call to the API and send it back with an additional instruction. For example, let's say we draft an email template for a customer, and we want to validate that the template follows some guidelines, we can send it back to the model with an instruction to check whether the guidelines are followed. We can also combine two different types of models, say the Whisper model into a text model, to perform tasks like summarizing discussion points and next steps from a meeting recording. Let's have a go at chaining Whisper with a chat model.\n",
    "- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trenton3983/DataCamp/master/Images/2024-01-29_working_with_the_openai_api/oai10.jpg)\n",
    "- **Chaining**: Feeding output from one model into another\n",
    "- Can use the same model multiple times\n",
    "  - **Example**: validating original response\n",
    "- Or different models\n",
    "  - **Example**: summarizing meeting recordings\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Example: Extracting meeting attendees: Let's use Whisper to extract the attendees from a meeting recording, where we know it starts with introductions from each of the attendees. We start by opening the audio file and assigning it audio_file. Next, we send the audio to the Whisper model and request a transcript with the transcribe method. To extract the transcript from the response, we extract the value from the text key. Now that we have the meeting transcript, we can use it to create a prompt for the chat model. The prompt starts with an instruction to extract the attendee names from the start of the transcript, then we append the transcript to the end. We're now ready to send the prompt to the chat model! We create a request to the Chat Completions endpoint using the create method. Inside, we specify the model to use and the messages to send, which is just the prompt in this case. Finally, we extract the response from the chat model. Extracting meeting attendees: And there we have it! As with all of these models, there's no guarantee that the models will be 100% accurate - Whisper could make a mistake in the transcript or the chat model may summarize incorrectly. It's important that any application of these models is well-tested, iterating on the prompts if necessary, to understand its performance thresholds. Additionally, usage should be restricted to only non-sensitive data, as we may risk breaching data governance laws by unjustly exposing employee or customer data.\n",
